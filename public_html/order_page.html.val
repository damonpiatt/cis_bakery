[CSE] Message number 1 in line 1:2:
An HTML5 DOCTYPE was found. HTML5 (sometimes called just
HTML) is in a constant state of flux. While many parts of
HTML5 are considered stable and safe to use, there are parts
that are not stable or that may not be well supported by
browsers. When using HTML5, be sure to understand the
potential problems when using parts and features that may
not be stable (and thus may change in the future) or that
may not be widely supported. Visit
https://www.htmlvalidator.com/help.php?m=3&h=safetouse for
information about what is safe to use.

A meta tag specifying the charset encoding was not found
within this document's "head" section. This could pose a
problem if the document is served locally or not served via
HTTP with an HTTP header that specifies the encoding.
Consider specifying the encoding in a meta tag. An example
"meta" tag for HTML5 documents is (if possible, place this
immediately after the "head" start-tag): <meta
charset="utf-8">

[CSE] Message number 3 in line 6:8:
Tip - A good title is important for search engine listings.
Try to use keywords and search terms in the title but keep
it readable and not too long. Don't just stuff keywords in
the title. The first words in the title are more likely to
result in higher rankings than subsequent words, so use
important keywords at the very beginning when reasonable.
The title should also be something that a user will want to
click on when it's listed on a search results page. A good
title is also important when a visitor bookmarks a page.
Example: <title>Download CSE HTML Validator - Powerful HTML
and Link Checking Software for Windows</title>. We recommend
that the "title" tag be one of the first tags inside the
"head" section (but after any meta charset or viewport
tags).

   6: <head><title>CIS Bakery</title></head>

[CSE] Message number 4 in line 6:14:
This document's title contains only 2 words. It may be
inadequate for search engine purposes. A good title is
important to your search engine rankings and listings.
Optimal page title length is 5-15 words and no more than 60
characters (Google typically displays the first 50-60
characters but it's a good idea to keep titles under 55
characters so they display properly most of the time). The
title should contain relevant and descriptive phrases and/or
relevant keywords and search terms while also remaining
human-readable. If possible, use important keywords at the
very beginning of the title.

Image searches can be a significant source of visitors and
traffic. Therefore, try to use keywords when naming images,
and separate keywords with hyphens (not underscores). This

[CSE] Message number 6 in line 8:2:
It is recommended that the "height" and "width" attributes
be used with the "img" element so browsers can leave the
correct amount of space for them while downloading the image
(which can take more time on mobile networks and devices).
This will also prevent issues and annoyances due to reflow
when the image becomes available or if image downloading is
disabled. This message is displayed up to 5 times.

[CSE] Message number 7 in line 8:2:
[7] Ensure that the "img" element is rarely, if ever, used
as a layout tool. Always use CSS for layout and positioning.
For example, do not use "img" elements to display
transparent images which rarely convey meaning and rarely
add anything useful to the document. This message is
displayed only once.

[CSE] Message number 8 in line 24:2:
With "table" elements, consider using the "width" CSS
property to specify the table width (by assigning a class
with the "class" attribute (preferred) or by using the
"style" attribute). Specifying the width is considered to be
good style and may cause the table and page to render
faster. Do not use the "width" attribute because it is not
valid for this document type. This message is displayed up
to 3 times.

Accessibility checking is off. This program can help you
make your web pages more accessible. An accessible page is
one that more individuals can use, such as individuals who
are blind or deaf. It can also increase the usefulness of
your web page for individuals who browse the web using
slower devices like older computers or wireless devices like
mobile phones and PDAs. An accessible web site makes good
business sense (and possibly good legal sense as well) and
may even improve search engine rankings. You can enable or
disable accessibility checking in the Validator Engine
Options.

[133] Mobility Tip #29 - Increase your website's speed!
Users don't like to wait around for slow sites. A website's
speed is very important for a positive user experience, and
is especially important when websites are accessed by
slower, network-limited devices. There are many techniques
to reduce page size and weight. Be familiar with them and
use as many as possible.

[CSE] Comment number 8:
<meta name="description" content="(actual description)">
should be used in the "head" section to provide a brief
description of what is contained on this page. Although
descriptions may not be used directly for rankings, search
engines may display descriptions in search results, with
bolding of the relevent keywords. Therefore, a good
description can help boost click-through rates and thus
increase traffic to a website. If you're using HTML
Validator's integrated editor, then this can be added from
the 'Tags' menu or from the HTML Inserter.

[CSE] Comment number 9:
Number of "a" links: 9, of which 0 (0.0%) have
rel="nofollow". Use rel="nofollow" to tell search engines
not to follow the link and tell Google not to transfer
PageRank or anchor text across the link. Use rel="nofollow"
for untrusted content, paid links, and crawl prioritization.
Visit https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/96569 for
more information.

[CSE] Comment number 10:
No italicizing, emphasizing, bolding, or strong tags were
used. Emphasizing or italicizing keywords (with the "em"
element) may improve rankings. Similarly, using strong text
or bolding keywords (with the "strong" element) may also
improve rankings.

[CSE] Comment number 11:
[113] Random Search Engine Tip #29 - STAY CRAWLABLE. Keep
sites and content crawlable and discoverable. Don't rely on
content and links in Flash, Java, Ajax, etc. that is
difficult for search engines to see and follow. Content that
search engines can't access cannot be indexed. Also, use
sitemaps (an XML file with a list of the pages on your site)
to ensure that search engines know about all the pages you
want indexed.
